# Changelog

## 0.1.1

- Oat UI 0.8.1. An `OatSubmitButton` on an `<input type="submit">` now renders as a button
  rather than a full-width text field, also inside a `fieldset.group`, and `OatDialog`
  content taller than the screen scrolls instead of being cut off.
- `OatAppLayout` renders its top bar as `<header data-topnav>` instead of `<nav data-topnav>`,
  since it holds the app name and custom content, not just navigation. It looks the same;
  update any CSS of your own that targets `nav[data-topnav]`.

## 0.1.0

First public release, published to Maven Central as `dev.jbaby:wicket-oat-core`.

- Apache Wicket 10 components and behaviors for [Oat UI](https://github.com/knadh/oat) 0.8.0,
  created with `new` or through the `Oat.Components` / `Oat.Behaviors` factories.
- General: buttons, badges, avatars, alerts, cards, empty states, feedback panel and toasts.
- Navigation and layout: `OatAppLayout`, accordion, button group, breadcrumb, tabs
  (`OatTabbedPanel`, `OatTabs`), pagination and paging navigators.
- Overlays: `OatDialog` (opened from the server, validates its body) and `OatDropdown`.
- Data display: `OatDataTable`, progress, meter, skeleton and spinner.
- Form fields that behave like the Wicket components they wrap (`CompoundPropertyModel`,
  labels from `.properties` files, inline validation feedback, `aria-*` wiring), from text and
  HTML5 inputs to choices, switches, tag input and file upload.
- 17 built-in themes plus custom themes, persisted in a cookie or a pluggable `OatThemeStore`.
- Works under Wicket's default strict, nonce-based Content Security Policy.
- Requires Java 17+ and Wicket 10.8.0+.
